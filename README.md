# Vibe-Analyzer
Android application that strips texts from a certain contact. This data is then sent to IBM Watson's Natural Understanding API to determine the emotions the contact feels towards the user. Made at Hack Princeton.

This was my first experience with Android Studio, and had just learned the basics a couple days before the hackathon. I have never worked with IBM Watson's API's before as well. It was a big learning experience and a hard struggle grind to achieve the app, but it was worth it.

The app was inspired when I thought of making something that could fix a social problem for my friend. He never knew whether a girl liked him or not or if the texts were showing that she vibed with him. So we made vibe.
